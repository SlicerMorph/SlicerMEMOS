MEMOS Model Weights Information
================================

RECOMMENDED MODEL (Better real-world performance):
File: /home/maga/Desktop/Memos-retraining/best_metric_model_largePatch (dice=0.72).pth
Training: 25,000 iterations with minimal augmentation
Validation Dice: 0.72
Real-world Performance: BETTER - generalizes well to clean images

NOT RECOMMENDED (Overfitted to augmentation):
File: /home/maga/Desktop/Memos-retraining/best_metric_model_largePatch.pth  
Training: 25,000 iterations with aggressive augmentation (multiplier=3)
Best Validation Dice: 0.9022 (at iteration 11,000)
Final Validation Dice: 0.9009
Real-world Performance: WORSE - learned augmentation artifacts

LESSON LEARNED:
===============
High validation Dice ≠ Better real-world performance
Aggressive augmentation can hurt generalization
Model needs to learn clean anatomical features, not noise patterns

For future retraining:
- Use augmentation_multiplier=1 or remove it entirely
- Reduce Gaussian noise intensity
- Focus on geometric augmentations (rotations, flips) only
- Validate on completely separate, clean test set
